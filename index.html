            <h3>Why is FRIENDS so popular?</h3>
            <p>
              This is a show about love and sex and careers and a time in life
              when everything is possible ... about the search for commitment
              and security ... and the fear of commitment and security. Most of
              all, it's about friendship--for when you're young and single in
              the city, your friends are your family.
            </p>
            <p>
              The show's enduring popularity isn't just down to a devoted fan
              base of nostalgic 30 and 40-somethings. It's also due to a new
              crop of binge-watching Gen Z-ers around the world who see
              themselves in its characters and situations, even though Friends
              premiered before some of them were even born.

                <p>
                  A truly classic episode of “Friends,” this story sees Phoebe
                  becoming a surrogate for her brother and his wife. That piece
                  of the story is sped up a bit unrealistically (but hey,
                  Phoebe's body has always been a little faster than Western
                  medicine), but it is touching and also a really clever way to
                  write in Kudrow's real-life pregnancy. That sweet and slightly
                  more serious story is balanced by Monica and Rachel getting
                  embroiled in a gambling battle with Chandler and Joey,
                  culminating in them losing their apartment in a game of
                  trivia.

                <p>
                  Ross and Rachel wake up in bed together, remembering almost
                  nothing about the night before. At breakfast, their friends
                  ask them about it. Neither Chandler nor Monica wants to go
                  through with their own marriage plans, but each one is scared
                  to back out. They decide to look for another sign... but even
                  though the signs keep coming, they keep denying it. Finally,
                  Chandler suggests they live together. Joey (who still has
                  Phoebe's cab) convinces her to keep him company on the drive
                  home. He promises to make it a fun road trip, but he ends up
                  sleeping most the time.

                <p>
                  Joey and Rachel already knew Monica and Chandler are together,
                  and Phoebe finds out, which leads to an intricate web of mind
                  games as she prefers to mess with the couple, rather than come
                  clean. Monica figures out Phoebe's so-called crush on Chandler
                  is fake, and she pushes Chandler to play an uncomfortable game
                  of sexual chicken with Phoebe. He cracks first, admitting he's
                  in love with Monica not just to Monica, but to all of the
                  friends (minus Ross, who's dealing with getting a new
                  apartment).
