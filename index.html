            <h3>Why is FRIENDS so popular?</h3>
            <p>
              This is a show about love and sex and careers and a time in life
              when everything is possible ... about the search for commitment
              and security ... and the fear of commitment and security. Most of
              all, it's about friendship--for when you're young and single in
              the city, your friends are your family.
            </p>
            <p>
              The show's enduring popularity isn't just down to a devoted fan
              base of nostalgic 30 and 40-somethings. It's also due to a new
              crop of binge-watching Gen Z-ers around the world who see
              themselves in its characters and situations, even though Friends
              premiered before some of them were even born.

              Hi! My name is Juliana and I've been living in Belgium for several
              years. I'm a very big fan of FRIENDS. I created this page as part
